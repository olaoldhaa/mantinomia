Greeting.

Don't hesitate to seek wisdom when you're young, and don't get tired of searching for it when you're older. There's no age limit for nurturing your soul. Saying it's too early or too late to study philosophy is like saying happiness has a specific timeframe. So, both young and old should pursue wisdom. Older people can feel young at heart with the knowledge they've gained, while younger people can become wise beyond their years and fearlessly face the future. We need to focus on the things that bring us happiness. When we have happiness, we have everything we need. And if we don't have it, all our efforts go towards finding it.

Focus on the things I've continually taught you, practice them, and consider them the foundation of a good life. First, believe in a God who is a living, immortal, and happy being, as most people generally perceive a deity. Ensure that your ideas about God align with his happiness and immortality. Indeed, gods exist, and we can know about them. However, their nature is different from what most people think, as people often don't hold consistent beliefs about them. The real impiety isn't denying the gods worshiped by many, but rather accepting the inaccurate beliefs that the majority holds about them. What most people say about gods is based on misconceptions rather than accurate understanding. The wicked experience great suffering, while the good receive significant blessings from the gods. The gods favor and delight in those who share their virtues and reject what doesn't align with their nature.

Get used to the idea that death doesn't affect us, because good and bad experiences require awareness, and death is the absence of all awareness. Realizing that death doesn't impact us helps us enjoy our mortal livesâ€”not by making them infinitely long, but by removing the desire for immortality. Life holds no fear for those who truly understand that there's nothing to fear in ceasing to exist. It's foolish to say you fear death, not because it will hurt when it arrives, but because it hurts to think about it. If something doesn't bother us when it's present, there's no reason for it to cause pain when we anticipate it. Death, the most dreadful of all evils, means nothing to us. When we're alive, death hasn't arrived; when death comes, we no longer exist. It doesn't concern either the living or the dead; it doesn't exist for the living, and the dead don't exist at all. People sometimes avoid death as the worst evil, while other times they choose it to escape life's hardships. A wise person neither dislikes life nor fears its end. They don't see life as a burden, nor do they consider its cessation as a misfortune. Just as we choose more enjoyable food rather than simply larger portions, the wise prioritize enjoying their time rather than merely prolonging it. Telling the young to live well and the old to die well is foolish, because the same principles teach us how to live and die gracefully. It's even worse to say it would be better not to be born, and once born, to swiftly pass into the afterlife. If someone truly believes this, why don't they leave life behind? If they're convinced, it would be easy to do. If they're joking, their words are still foolish, as listeners won't take them seriously.

Keep in mind that the future is not entirely within our control, nor is it entirely beyond our reach. We shouldn't rely on it as if it's guaranteed to unfold as planned, nor should we lose hope as if it's completely out of our hands.

It's essential to understand that some desires are natural, while others are baseless. Among the natural desires, some are both necessary and natural, while others are merely natural. Necessary desires can be those required for happiness, for relieving bodily discomfort, or even for survival. With a clear understanding of these desires, we can make choices and avoidances that promote physical health and mental tranquility, which together form the basis of a happy life. The ultimate goal of our actions is to be free from pain and fear. When we achieve this state, our soul is at peace since we no longer need to search for something missing or seek anything else to fulfill our body and soul's well-being. We only crave pleasure when we're in pain, which is why we consider pleasure the beginning and end of a happy life. Pleasure is our first and most natural good; it's where every choice and avoidance begins and ends, and it serves as the standard by which we judge all good things. Although pleasure is inherently good, we don't choose every pleasure. We sometimes forgo certain pleasures if they lead to greater discomfort. We might also see enduring pain as preferable when it ultimately results in a more significant pleasure. Therefore, not all pleasure is worth pursuing, just as not all pain is worth avoiding. We must weigh the pros and cons to make accurate judgments, sometimes treating the good as evil and vice versa. We value self-sufficiency and not relying on external things too much. This doesn't mean we always use little, but rather that we're content with little when we don't have much. We genuinely believe that those who need luxury the least enjoy it the most, and that natural things are easily acquired while vain and worthless things are hard to obtain. Simple food can be as satisfying as an expensive meal once hunger is gone, and even bread and water can provide the greatest pleasure to those who are famished. Therefore, getting used to a simple, low-cost diet provides everything necessary for health and enables us to face life's challenges without fear. It also makes us appreciate luxurious food more when we occasionally indulge, and it helps us become more resilient in the face of life's uncertainties.

When we say that pleasure is the ultimate goal, we don't mean indulgence or excessive sensuality, as some may misunderstand or misrepresent our stance. By pleasure, we mean the absence of pain in the body and the absence of trouble in the soul. A pleasant life isn't derived from constant partying, sexual love, or enjoying luxurious food. Instead, it comes from sober reasoning, evaluating the reasons behind our choices and avoidances, and dispelling beliefs that cause significant distress in our souls. The foundation of all this is prudence, which is even more valuable than other virtues. A life of pleasure cannot exist without prudence, honor, and justice, and a life of prudence, honor, and justice cannot exist without pleasure. The virtues are intertwined with a pleasant life, and a pleasant life is inseparable from these virtues.

So, who do you think is superior to someone who embodies these virtues? This person has a sacred understanding of the gods and is entirely free from the fear of death. They've carefully considered the limits set by nature, realizing that the extent of good things can be easily reached, while the duration or intensity of evils is usually minimal. They dismiss the notion of destiny as the ruler of all things, arguing instead that some events occur by necessity, others by chance, and still others through our actions. They recognize that necessity eliminates accountability, chance is unpredictable, and our actions are the only realm where praise and blame can truly be assigned. In fact, it's preferable to believe in the myths of the gods rather than submit to the destiny imposed by natural philosophers. Belief in the gods offers a glimmer of hope that we might escape misfortune if we honor them, while the naturalists' concept of necessity is unresponsive to any plea. The wise person doesn't see chance as a deity, as it lacks order, and they don't consider it a cause, even an uncertain one, of good or evil. While chance might initiate significant good or evil, it doesn't directly determine happiness in life. This individual believes that the misfortune of the wise is better than the prosperity of the foolish. Ultimately, it's preferable that well-judged actions don't rely on chance for successful outcomes.

Practice these and similar principles day and night, both alone and with those who share your values. By doing so, you'll never be disturbed, whether awake or dreaming, and you'll live like a god among people. Immersing yourself in these timeless virtues allows you to rise above the mortal realm, as you'll be surrounded by the blessings of immortality.
