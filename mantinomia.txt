Where should I begin? For me it makes sense to begin with the immediate experience. What am I experiencing right now. What do I know, what do I believe. What is my past. What are my plans for the future. Why are these my plans? What do I need to do right now?

I see, I hear, I smell, I taste, I touch. I feel. I think. I remember a past and I have a plan for a future. There are some things I know and some things I trust. There are acts I want to do, acts that I should do and acts that I must do. I have power, I am curious, I am loving, I can produce, I am creative, I respect and I have needs. 

In the dialogue "Phaedrus," Plato illustrates the nature of the human soul. He portrays the soul as a chariot pulled by two winged horses and driven by a charioteer.
The charioteer represents reason and intellect, responsible for steering the soul towards virtue and truth. One horse represents the noble aspect of human nature, embodying courage, morality, and a desire for honor. This horse is well-behaved and easy to control. The other horse embodies base desires and emotions, such as lust, greed, and pride. This horse is unruly and difficult to control.The analogy illustrates the struggle within the human soul to achieve balance and harmony. For the chariot to reach its destination, the charioteer must exert control over both horses, using reason and intellect to guide the noble aspects of human nature while reining in the base desires.

I find there to be some truth to this notion in reflecting upon my own experience. I however find that I do not only have two driving forces within me, but seven. I regard these forces as personalities in themselves, with each their own motive and reasoning, gathered around the table that is my mind, to discuss my affairs. The seven forces consists of the Warrior, the Philosopher, the Family, the Worker, the Artist, the Citizen and the Human. I myself is the leader of these, not the one to act, but the one to listen, compromise and decide what will be done. I'm not always in charge as these forces are can become much stronger than me at times. Yet, every now and then I shine through, I manage my task and the day becomes good. This is Mantinomia, achieving the golden mean, balancing between conlificting forces, a compromise between great contradictions, Magnae Antinomiae - Mantinomia.

Mantinomia is not happiness, it's not pleasure, it's not richness. It is however fulfillment, it is success. In many ways it resembles Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia. This is a state of human flourishing or well-being that comes from living a virtuous life. Aristotle believed that achieving eudaimonia required cultivating virtues such as courage, justice, wisdom, and moderation, and that these virtues should be practiced and developed over time through habits and actions. Further more he believed that eudaimonia was the ultimate goal of human existence and that it was attainable through living a life of moral excellence and virtuous action. Mantinomia however focuses on seven virtues, one for each force. These virtues are strenght, knowledge, care, production, beauty, respect and peace.

Where has all this lead me? Does this meditation have any practical meaning? Having made up an understanding, a standing, what is the next reasonable move? Remember Sammy Jenkis. I need to write this down. Where do I begin to tell this? Where is a reasonable start? I see, I hear, I smell, I taste, I touch. I feel. I think. I remember a past and I have a plan for a future. There are some things I know and some things I trust. There are acts I want to do, acts that I should do and acts that I must do. I have power, I am curious, I am loving, I can produce, I am creative, I respect and I have needs.
